<h1 align="center">Programming Challenges</h1>

Welcome to the index of Jupyter Notebooks for the Programming Challenges repository! The main goal of this project is to offer automated solutions for the challenges listed in the "code_challenge.csv" file. Leveraging the capabilities of ChatGPT, an advanced AI language model, we provide solutions in five different programming languages.

## Table of Contents

1. [Analyzing the Programming Challenges](#analyzing-the-programming-challenges)
2. [Automated Solutions for the Challenges](#automated-solutions-for-the-challenges)

## Analyzing the Programming Challenges

In this section, we thoroughly analyze the programming challenges presented in the "code_challenge.csv" file.

## Automated Solutions for the Challenges

Here, you'll find Jupyter Notebooks containing the automated solutions generated by ChatGPT for each of the listed challenges. We've implemented the solutions in five different programming languages to showcase their versatility.

### Notebooks:

1. [Analyzing the Programming Challenges](analyzing-the-programming-challenges.ipynb)
2. [Automated Solutions for the Challenges](automated-solutions-for-the-challenges.ipynb)

Feel free to explore each notebook to understand the challenges and their corresponding automated solutions.

We hope you find these automated solutions helpful and educational. Happy coding! ðŸš€
